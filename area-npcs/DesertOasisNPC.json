          "question": "Ssssup, friend! I'm Lizzy! The desert can be really tough — super hot days, cold nights, not much water. But I've learned to adapt! Do you know what it means to adapt?",
          "yes_response": "Great! Adapting means changing how we do things when our situation changes. Like how I hide in the shade when it's hot and sun myself when it's cold. Life changes, and we learn to change with it!",
          "no_response": "Let me explain! Adapting means adjusting to new situations. When things change around us, we find new ways to handle them. Like me — I can't change the desert, but I can change what I do to survive it!",

          "yes_response": "That's a valuable skill! Being resourceful means you don't need everything to be perfect to succeed. You can work with what's available. That's a superpower that will help you your whole life!",
          "no_response": "It takes practice! Being resourceful means looking at what you DO have instead of what you don't. Got a broken toy? Maybe it becomes something new! Not enough of something? Get creative! You can learn this!",

          "yes_response": "That's wonderful! Being able to shift gears quickly is so helpful. Life throws surprises at us, and those who can adjust quickly have an easier time. Keep that flexible spirit!",
          "no_response": "Sudden changes can be really hard! Our brains like to know what's coming. But here's a tip: take a breath, look around, and ask 'What can I do RIGHT NOW?' Focus on the next small step, not everything at once.",

          "yes_response": "That's smart adapting! Knowing how to behave in different situations is a really useful skill. It doesn't mean you're being fake — it means you're being aware of what each place needs. That's maturity!",
          "no_response": "It's something you'll learn! Different places have different needs. We can be ourselves AND adjust how we show up. Like being quiet in a library but cheering loud at a game. Same you, different settings!",

          "no_response": "It can be hard to think about! But sometimes we have to let go of small things to save bigger things — like leaving behind a toy to catch a bus, or skipping a game to help a friend. Knowing what matters most helps us choose.",

          "no_response": "It can be disappointing when we can't have what we want! But being stuck on only one option can make us miss other good things. Next time something's not available, try thinking: 'What ELSE could work?'",

          "no_response": "It's easy to get stuck on one idea! But most problems have several possible solutions. Try brainstorming — come up with three different ways to solve something before picking one. You might surprise yourself!",

          "yes_response": "Absolutely! Flexibility helps us handle whatever life throws at us. Rigid things break under pressure, but flexible things bend and bounce back. You understand something really important about life!",
          "no_response": "It really is! Think about a tree — if it couldn't bend in the wind, it would snap. We're the same way. Being a little flexible helps us not break when things get tough. Bend, don't break!",
          "key_takeaway": "Flexibility helps us handle challenges without breaking. Rigid things snap under pressure."

          "yes_response": "That's a powerful belief! Hard times don't just have to be survived — they can actually make us stronger and teach us things. You have a growth mindset, and that will carry you far!",
          "no_response": "It might be hard to imagine right now. But here's the truth: some of the strongest creatures I know became strong BECAUSE of hard times, not in spite of them. Challenges can build us up if we let them.",

          "no_response": "That's okay! Adapting is a skill that grows over time. Start by noticing when things change and asking 'How can I work with this?' Small steps lead to big flexibility. I believe in you! 🦎",

          "yes_response": "Wonderful! Perseverance means keeping going even when things are hard. It's not about being the fastest — it's about not stopping. That's how I cross deserts, and that's how you'll reach your goals too!",
          "no_response": "Let me share! Perseverance means continuing even when things get difficult. When the journey is long and hot, I keep putting one hoof in front of the other. That steady effort is what gets me across the desert!",

          "no_response": "Everyone needs reserves! Think about what gives you energy — sleep, food, time with people you love, fun activities. These fill your tank so you can keep going when things are hard. Find your reserves!",

          "no_response": "That's very honest! Wanting to stop when things are uncomfortable is natural. But here's what I've learned: some discomfort is just part of the journey. We can handle more than we think if we take it step by step.",

          "no_response": "It's easy to rush! We want to be done NOW. But pacing — going at a steady speed you can keep up — actually gets us further. Think tortoise and hare! Slow and steady really does win the race.",

          "yes_response": "That's real faith in yourself! When we can't see progress, it's easy to give up. But progress is often happening under the surface, like roots growing before a plant shows. Keep walking — your oasis is ahead!",
          "no_response": "It's so hard when we can't see results! We wonder if it's worth it. But remember: just because you can't see the oasis doesn't mean it's not there. Sometimes we have to trust the journey a little longer.",

          "no_response": "It's worth thinking about! For me, it's remembering why the journey matters and knowing I'll eventually rest. What could help you? Friends? Breaks? Hope? Finding your support makes heavy loads lighter.",

          "yes_response": "Yes! Each tiny step matters, even when it feels pointless. One grain of sand doesn't look like much, but together they make a whole desert! Your small efforts are building something big. Trust the process!",
          "no_response": "It's hard to feel that way sometimes! When progress is invisible, small efforts seem useless. But trust me — I've crossed whole deserts one step at a time. Your small efforts ARE adding up, even if you can't see it yet.",

          "no_response": "It can be hard to get up after a fall. We feel tired or embarrassed. But here's what I know: the ones who reach the oasis aren't the ones who never fell — they're the ones who got back up. You can too.",

          "no_response": "It's a helpful trick! When something feels too big, ask yourself: 'What's just ONE thing I can do right now?' Focus only on that. Then the next thing. Big journeys are just lots of small steps in a row!",

Things look different from high up — smaller problems seem tinier, and I can see paths that are hidden on the ground. Have you ever noticed that problems look different depending on how you look at them?",

          "yes_response": "Seeing the big picture helps so much! When we zoom out, we notice things we missed and remember what really matters. And focusing on what's in front of us is useful too — the key is knowing when to do each!",
