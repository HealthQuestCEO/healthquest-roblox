          "no_response": "That's fortunate. But when pain does come — and it comes to everyone — remember: it doesn't have to stay pain. It can become something else. Dragons know how to transform flames.",

          "no_response": "If they come, remember this: strong feelings aren't bad. They're energy. Like fire, they can destroy OR they can fuel. Learning to direct them is the dragon way.",
