          "yes_response": "That's so wonderful! Everyone needs a safe spot — a place where you can relax and just be yourself. It might be your room, a cozy corner, or even someone's arms. Your safe place is like my anemone — it helps you feel protected!",
          "no_response": "That's okay! Sometimes it takes time to find our safe spots. A safe place could be anywhere you feel calm — a comfy chair, under a blanket, or even outside under a tree. Let's think about where you might feel most peaceful!",

          "no_response": "Asking for help is hard for lots of us! We might worry about being a bother or looking weak. But here's a secret: asking for help is actually brave. And most people feel happy when they get to help someone they care about!",

          "no_response": "That's okay! Here's something cool: just knowing you HAVE a safe place can help you feel braver, even when you're not there. It's like carrying a little bit of safety with you wherever you go. Try it and see!",

          "no_response": "That's okay — it can take time to figure out! Try noticing when you feel calm and peaceful. What's happening? Where are you? Who's there? Those clues can help you discover what makes you feel safe.",

          "no_response": "That's great that your safe place helps so much! But if worries ever do sneak in, don't be surprised. It happens to everyone. The good news is, you're still safe, and the worried feeling will pass.",

          "no_response": "That's okay! Here's something easy to try: if you see someone who looks sad or scared, you could smile at them or ask if they're okay. Sometimes small things help people feel less alone. You might be someone's safe friend!",

          "no_response": "That's okay! Whether your safe places have changed or stayed the same, what matters is that you have them. As you grow, you might find new safe spots too. Your heart knows how to find safety!",

          "no_response": "That's okay! Finding safety takes time. Just remember: you deserve to feel safe, and it's okay to need help. Whenever you're ready, your safe places and safe people will be there. I believe in you, friend! 🐠",

          "yes_response": "Oh, I understand! The world tells us to rush, rush, rush! But here's what I've learned: going slowly doesn't mean you're behind. It means you're being careful and steady. The reef wasn't built in a day! You're doing just fine.",

          "no_response": "That's okay! Someday you might have a goal that takes a long time. When that happens, remember old Shelly — one flipper stroke at a time. You don't have to do it all at once. Just keep going!",

          "no_response": "How wise you are! Knowing that your pace is your own is a real gift. Some things you'll learn quickly, and some will take more time. Both are perfectly fine. You're swimming your own journey!",

          "no_response": "You have a strong spirit! Not giving up, even when things are hard, is real courage. And remember, it's okay to rest sometimes. Resting isn't the same as giving up. Then you can keep swimming!",

          "no_response": "What wonderful trust you have! Believing you'll get there, even when you can't see it yet, is a special kind of strength. That trust will carry you through many journeys in life!",

          "no_response": "How patient you are! Waiting calmly is a skill many creatures struggle with. If you ever do find waiting hard, just remember — good things often need time. The waiting is part of the journey.",

          "yes_response": "That's great! Having tools to calm down when we're scared is so important. Keep using what works for you. And remember, it's okay to feel scared — what matters is that you know how to help yourself feel better.",
          "no_response": "Let me share a trick! When fear comes, try breathing slowly — in for 4 counts, out for 4 counts. This tells your brain 'I'm safe.' You can also try squeezing your hands tight and then letting go. Find what works for you!",

          "yes_response": "That's amazing! Facing our fears in small steps is one of the best ways to overcome them. Each small step teaches your brain 'I can handle this.' You're already conquering fears! Keep going!",
          "no_response": "That's okay! When you're ready, try this: face something small that scares you — just a tiny bit. Then do it again. Over time, the fear shrinks. You don't have to do it all at once!",

          "yes_response": "That's really wise! Helpful fear says 'this is actually dangerous' — like staying away from fire. Unhelpful fear says 'what if something bad happens' when nothing dangerous is really there. Knowing the difference is powerful!",
          "no_response": "It can be tricky! Ask yourself: 'Is there REAL danger here?' Fear of a burning fire is helpful — that's real danger. Fear of raising your hand in class? That's not real danger. That fear is trying to protect you from embarrassment, not harm.",
