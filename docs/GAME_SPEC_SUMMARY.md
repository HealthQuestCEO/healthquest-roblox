## Key Design Principles

1. **All coins earned in castle** - Classroom (lessons) + Lumo Care (emotion guessing)
2. **Coins spent on Lumo** - Care costs create pressure to do lessons
3. **Diminishing returns** - Encourages buying new barriers vs. grinding same quest
4. **72-hour pressure** - Must care for Lumo or lose access to outside castle
5. **Evolution rewards loyalty** - Long-term care reduces costs
6. **SMART goals** - Barrier results personalize the wellness journey
